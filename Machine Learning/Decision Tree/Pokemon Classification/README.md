Hello!!

In this project I'll use the decision tree method in order to classify a pokemon database into legendary/non-legendary pokemons. In order to do it, i'll use a pokemon database downloaded from kaggle with all pokemon's main stats.

In the Jupyter Notebook I'll make some exploratory analysis and then will got to the decision tree creation itself.

In the end, I'll measure the tree precision and its capabilities into predicting a pokemon's legendary nature.

Hope you'll enjoy!
