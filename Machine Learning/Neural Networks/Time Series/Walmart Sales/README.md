Hello!! 

Here I'll exercise my LSTM skills trying to predict the arrivals for a fictional company orders. The selected dataset provides a comprehensive view of the company's order and distribution processes.

For this purpose, i'll be using Kaggles US_Regional_Sales_Data dataset, which can be found in the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dorothyjoel/us-regional-sales). I'll start with some exploratory analysis and then proceed to build and train my model. The last step will be to evaluate it's capabilities to predict results.

I'll be using the pytorch library for this analysis.

Hope you'll enjoy it.
