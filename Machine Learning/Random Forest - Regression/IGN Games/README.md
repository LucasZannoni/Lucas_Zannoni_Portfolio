Hello!!

In this analysis i'll use a game database from IGN and try to predict if the game score.

For making this prediction I'll be using a random forest - Regression algorithm with the sklearn library.

I'll start with a exploratory Analysis and then proceed to the regression and estimation of values.

Hope you'll enjoy it!!
