Hello,

I'll dedicate this folder to the analysis of a cars database. Here the main goal will be to use the random forest method in order to be able to make predictions about the data.

In the notebook, i'll consolidate the db, make a quick exploratory analysis and the proceed to assemble the RF model. 

Hope you'll enjoy it!!
