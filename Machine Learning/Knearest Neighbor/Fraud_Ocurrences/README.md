Hello!!

In this project I'll use the Knearest method in order to determine if, given a combination of transaction value and distance from user's home, there has been any kind of fraud with the transaction.

For this i'll use a transactions database with the aforementioned data. First i'll make a exploratory analysis, then split and standarize the data, make the predictions and, for last, optmize my model.

Hope you'll enjoy it!!
