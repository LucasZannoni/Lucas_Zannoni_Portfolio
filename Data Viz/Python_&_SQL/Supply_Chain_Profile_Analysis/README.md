Hello!!

Here I'll simulate a hipotetical Supply Chain scenario, where the company being analysed imports products from different countries and has supplying agreeements with each supplier in it's database.

In this analysis I will create 3 fictional databases, a supplier database, a sales database and a prodcut one and will join then in order to perform different supplier performance analysis. The ideia here is to generate insight from raw information databases simulating a real life Supply Chain business case.

Hope you'll enjoy it!
