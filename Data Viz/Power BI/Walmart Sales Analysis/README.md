Hello!!

Here I'll analyse a fictional Walmart Sales profile in order to provide main insights about the business indicators and performance related to its products and sales, such as product sales value, revenue, clients review and purchase profile per client.

I'll be getting data from 4 different databases, a products database with all available products infos, a sales database with sales registers, a clients database and, for last, a branch reviews database.

Hope you'll enjoy it!
