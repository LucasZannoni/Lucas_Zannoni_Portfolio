Hello!!

Here I'll analyse a fictional Spotify streamings database using the software Power BI. The goal here will be to analyse, explore and get main insights of this platform metrics, such as listeners main profiles, most streamed/inserted in playlists artists and comparison to other competitors platforms' performances.

I'll be using 3 different databases, one with the musics main infos, one with stream infos and another with the likeness info and I'll be joining them as I see necessary into my analysis.

Hope you'll enjoy it!
